## Title - To learn how to use conditional statements in python .

## Theory 
Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a given condition is True or False. These statements help in controlling the flow of execution and make programs more dynamic and logical.

In Python, conditional statements are implemented using:
if
if-else
if-elif-else
Nested if statements

#### The if Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only when a specified condition is true.If the condition evaluates to True, the statement inside the block is executed. If it is False, the block is skipped.

##### SYNTAX 

if condition:

    statement


#### The if-else Statement
The if-else statement is used when there are two possible outcomes. If the condition is true, the if block executes; otherwise, the else block executes.

##### SYNTAX

if condition:

    statement1
    
else:

    statement2

#### The if-elif-else Statement
The if-elif-else ladder is used when multiple conditions need to be checked. Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom and executes the block corresponding to the first true condition.

##### SYNTAX

if condition1:
    statement1
    
elif condition2:

    statement2
    
else:

    statement3

#### Nested if Statements
A nested if statement is an if statement inside another if statement. It is used when a condition depends on another condition.

##### SYNTAX

if condition1:

    if condition2:
    
        statement

        
#### Indentation in Python
Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code. Proper indentation is mandatory in conditional statements, otherwise it results in an error.   

#### Comparison and Logical Operators
Conditional statements use comparison and logical operators:
Comparison Operators:
##### == (equal to)
##### != (not equal to)
##### > (greater than)
##### < (less than)
##### >= (greater than or equal to)
##### <= (less than or equal to)

#### Logical Operators:
##### and

##### or

##### not

These operators help in forming complex conditions.


## Conclusion 
Conditional statements are an essential part of Python programming. They help in decision-making and controlling the flow of execution. By using if, if-else, if-elif-else, and nested if statements, programs can handle different situations efficiently and produce appropriate outputs based on given conditions.
